1. 
SQL query:
join crime_assaults with unemployment_rate for each states and each year. 
the result will show the unemployment rate and number of assaults in each state each year. 

Transformation: 
1) map agency_code in crime_assaults to states, count total assaults in each state in each year
transform_crime_assualt_cluster.py

2) map state in unemployment_rate into acronym. We will use ParDo to implement out queries.
